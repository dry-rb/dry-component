## 0.19.0 2020-11-26


### Added

- `Dry::System::Mixins::Singleton` module in order for the container to resolve to a single instance when injected while also allowing to create new instances when unit testing by allowing to pass mocked dependencies

### Changed

- `Dry::System::Loader` singleton? method now doesn't check if it doesn't respond to .new

### Fixed

- Made `Booter#boot_files` a public method again, since it was required by dry-rails (@timriley)


[Compare v0.18.0...v0.18.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.1)

## 0.18.0 2020-08-24


### Added

- New `bootable_dirs` setting on `Dry::System::Container`, which accepts paths to multiple directories for looking up bootable component files. (@timriley in PR #151)

  For each entry in the `bootable_dirs` array, relative directories will be appended to the container's `root`, and absolute directories will be left unchanged.

  When searching for bootable files, the first match will win, and any subsequent same-named files will not be loaded. In this way, the `bootable_dirs` act similarly to the `$PATH` in a shell environment.

## 0.13.0 2019-10-13


### Added

- `Container.resolve` accepts and optional block parameter which will be called if component cannot be found. This makes dry-system consistent with dry-container 0.7.2 (flash-gordon)
  ```ruby
  App.resolve('missing.dep') { :fallback } # => :fallback
  ```

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `Container.key?` triggers lazy-loading for not finalized containers. If component wasn't found it returns `false` without raising an error. This is a breaking change, if you seek the previous behavior, use `Container.registered?` (flash-gordon)

## 0.10.0 2018-06-07


### Added

- You can now set a custom inflector on the container level. As a result, the `Loader`'s constructor accepts two arguments: `path` and `inflector`, update your custom loaders accordingly (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
  class MyContainer < Dry::System::Container
    configure do |config|
      config.inflector = Dry::Inflector.new do |inflections|
        inflections.acronym('API')

[Compare v0.7.0...v0.7.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1)

## 0.7.0 2017-06-15


### Added

- Added `manual_registrar` container setting (along with default `ManualRegistrar` implementation), and `registrations_dir` setting. These provide support for a well-established place for keeping files with manual container registrations (timriley)
- AutoRegistrar parses initial lines of Ruby source files for "magic comments" when auto-registering components. An `# auto_register: false` magic comment will prevent a Ruby file from being auto-registered (timriley)
- `Container.auto_register!`, when called with a block, yields a configuration object to control the auto-registration behavior for that path, with support for configuring 2 different aspects of auto-registration behavior (both optional):

  ```ruby
  class MyContainer < Dry::System::Container
    auto_register!('lib') do |config|
      config.instance do |component|
        # custom logic for initializing a component
      end

      config.exclude do |component|
        # return true to skip auto-registration of the component, e.g.
        # component.path =~ /entities/
      end
    end
  end
  ```
- A helpful error will be raised if a bootable component's finalize block name doesn't match its boot file name (GustavoCaso)

### Changed

- The `default_namespace` container setting now supports multi-level namespaces (GustavoCaso)
- `Container.auto_register!` yields a configuration block instead of a block for returning a custom instance (see above) (GustavoCaso)
- `Container.import` now requires an explicit local name for the imported container (e.g. `import(local_name: AnotherContainer)`) (timriley)

## 0.5.0 2016-08-15

for multi-container setups. As part of this release `dry-system` has been renamed to `dry-system`.

### Added

- Boot DSL with:
  - Lifecycle triggers: `init`, `start` and `stop` (solnic)
  - `use` method which auto-boots a dependency and makes it available in the booting context (solnic)
- When a component relies on a bootable component, and is being loaded in isolation, the component will be booted automatically (solnic)

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `Dry::Component::Container` is now `Dry::System::Container` (solnic)
- [BREAKING] Configurable `loader` is now a class that accepts container's config and responds to `#constant` and `#instance` (solnic)
- [BREAKING] `core_dir` renameda to `system_dir` and defaults to `system` (solnic)
- [BREAKING] `auto_register!` yields `Component` objects (solnic)

## 0.4.3 2016-08-01


### Fixed

- Return immediately from `Container.load_component` if the requested component key already exists in the container. This fixes a crash when requesting to load a manually registered component with a name that doesn't map to a filename (timriley in [#24](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/24))

### Fixed

- Require the 0.4.0 release of dry-auto_inject for the features below (in 0.4.0) to work properly (timriley)


[Compare v0.4.0...v0.4.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

## 0.4.0 2016-07-26


### Added

- Support for supplying a default namespace to a container, which is passed to the container's injector to allow for convenient shorthand access to registered objects in the same namespace (timriley in [#20](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/20))

  ```ruby
  # Set up container with default namespace
  module Admin
    class Container < Dry::Component::Container
      configure do |config|
        config.root = Pathname.new(__dir__).join("../..")
        config.default_namespace = "admin"
      end
    end

    Import = Container.injector
  end

  module Admin
    class CreateUser
      # "users.repository" will resolve an Admin::Users::Repository instance,
      # where previously you had to identify it as "admin.users.repository"
      include Admin::Import["users.repository"]
    end
  end
  ```
- Support for supplying to options directly to dry-auto_inject's `Builder` via `Dry::Component::Container#injector(options)`. This allows you to provide dry-auto_inject customizations like your own container of injection strategies (timriley in [#20](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/20))
- Support for accessing all available injector strategies, not just the defaults (e.g. `MyContainer.injector.some_custom_strategy`) (timriley in [#19](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/19))

### Changed

- Subclasses of `Dry::Component::Container` no longer have an `Injector` constant automatically defined within them. The recommended approach is to save your own injector object to a constant, which allows you to pass options to it at the same time, e.g. `MyApp::Import = MyApp::Container.injector(my_options)` (timriley in [#19](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/19))

### Changed

- Removed two pieces that are moving to dry-web:
- Removed `env` setting from `Container` (timriley)
- Removed `Dry::Component::Config` and `options` setting from `Container` (timriley)
- Changed `Component#configure` behavior so it can be run multiple times for configuration to be applied in multiple passes (timriley)

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where specified auto-inject strategies were not respected (timriley)

### Changed

- Component core directory is now `component/` by default (timriley)
- Injector default stragegy is now whatever dry-auto_inject's default is (rather than hard-coding a particular default strategy for dry-system) (timriley)

[Compare v0.1.0...v0.2.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

## 0.1.0 2016-06-07


### Added

- Provide a dependency injector as an `Inject` constant inside any subclass of `Dry::Component::Container`. This injector supports all of `dry-auto_inject`'s default injection strategies, and will lazily load any dependencies as they are injected. It also supports arbitrarily switching strategies, so they can be used in different classes as required (e.g. `include MyComponent::Inject.args["dep"]`) (timriley)
- Support aliased dependency names when calling the injector object (e.g. `MyComponent::Inject[foo: "my_app.foo", bar: "another.thing"]`) (timriley)
- Allow a custom dependency loader to be set on a container via its config (AMHOL)

  ```ruby
  class MyContainer < Dry::Component::Container
    configure do |config|
      # other config
      config.loader = MyLoader
    end
  end
  ```

### Changed

- `Container.boot` now only makes a simple `require` for the boot file (solnic)
- Container object is passed to `Container.finalize` blocks (solnic)
- Allow `Pathname` objects passed to `Container.require` (solnic)
- Support lazily loading missing dependencies from imported containers (solnic)
- `Container.import_module` renamed to `.injector` (timriley)
- Default injection strategy is now `kwargs`, courtesy of the new dry-auto_inject default (timriley)
